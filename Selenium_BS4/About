#Selenium is the file used to get API requests from AIRBNB including variable information such as occupancy and nightly rates, written in Python.
#As of 4/20/22 it only prints this information to the output, but it will save it to a JSON file. 
#It is a variant on the initial file for the API requests ('scrappy) but able to scan interactive parts of the javascript (e.g. nightly rates and calendar availability)
#Selenium is the engine and the parser is called Beautiful Soup
